   - Write clean, readable code
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run unit tests
   pytest tests/unit/
   
   # Run integration tests
   pytest tests/integration/
   
   # Check code coverage
   pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
   
   # Lint your code
   flake8 src/
   black src/
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** (see [Commit Messages](#commit-messages))

### Mental Health Considerations in Code

When developing features:
- Consider users in various mental states
- Avoid overwhelming UI elements
- Provide clear, calming feedback
- Include appropriate content warnings
- Respect user privacy and data

## üé® Style Guidelines

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with these additions:

```python
# Good: Clear, descriptive names
def calculate_energy_level(mood_score: float, sleep_hours: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate user's energy level based on mood and sleep.
    
    Args:
        mood_score: Current mood rating (0-10)
        sleep_hours: Hours of sleep last night
        
    Returns:
        Energy level as percentage (0-100)
    """
    # Implementation here
    
# Bad: Unclear naming
def calc_e(m, s):
    # Implementation here
```

### UI/UX Guidelines

- **Color Usage**: Consider color-blind users and those sensitive to bright colors
- **Animations**: Keep them subtle and provide option to disable
- **Text**: Use clear, simple language avoiding mental health jargon
- **Icons**: Use universally understood symbols
- **Spacing**: Provide adequate whitespace to avoid overwhelming users

### Documentation Style

- Write in clear, simple English
- Avoid mental health stigma in language
- Include examples for complex features
- Add screenshots for UI changes
- Document accessibility features

fix(tasks): prevent task overflow during low energy periods

Tasks are now properly queued when user energy drops below 30%.
